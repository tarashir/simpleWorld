# simpleWorld
REQUIRES TKINTER

The most simplistic of rendering engines that allows you to walk around a world with a 3D rendered cube.  Many bugs but mainly just to show potential.  I made this in just a couple hours specifically to demonstrate my knowledge of real time rendering and don't currently have time to flush out a fully functional engine.  Given time I'm sure I could fix the bugs but I am very busy this semester.

## How to operate

Simply run the program and use WASD to move around, QE to move up and down, and the arrow keys to rotate the camera.

While this renders just a single cube, it can theoretically, albeit with bugs, render as many objects as necessary.
