# simpleWorld
The most simplistic of rendering engines that allows you to walk around a world with a 3D rendered cube.  Many bugs but mainly just to show potential.

Use WASD to move around, QE to move up and down, and the arrow keys to rotate the camera.

While this renders just a single cube, it can theoretically, albeit with bugs, render as many objects as necessary.
